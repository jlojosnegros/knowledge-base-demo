# Here is a documentation knowledge base demo

This is a infrastructure proposal to build our own knowledgebase as a team and to host our documentation.

## Use Github/GitPages

This is all handled using github and git pages.
This, as Martin pointed in the meeting, give us all the features that comes with version control as history, traceability, reviews and comments etc.
It also gives us automatic deploy on each change with git actions.

## No need to learn new syntax

All the content is done in Markdown.
That avoid the need to learn new syntax and allow us to visualize an create the content with any of our text editors of choice.

The render can handle all the [[MarkdownDemo|Markdown standar syntax]]

> [!note] Can also handle a superset of interesting features [[ExtraFeatures| as you can see here]]

## Zero effort PoC

All this repository and the deployment of the server has been obtained with almost zero effort from [this template](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-mkdocs-publisher-template)

We also have a "vanilla" server with navigation capabilies ( on left ) a "Table of Content" of each page ( on righ) and a search box, all for free.

This gives us the possibility to start adding content with no investment and see if this idea could help us.

### ... but extensible

All the documentation build is based on [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) which is a well known system with a lot of documentation and easy to expand.

## Final note

If this idea ends up catching your interest it could be interesting to take a look at [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

Obsidian is nothing more than a Mardown editor on steroids that I have been using as a note taking application for some time and that would make Markdown note editting quite simple.
